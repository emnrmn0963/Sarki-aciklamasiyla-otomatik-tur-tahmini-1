Doküman ID: 15, Skor: 1.0000, Metin: As a young, struggling beat group, playing grueling gigs at grubby bars,�the Beatles�had an in-joke to cheer themselves up: declaring that they were going \"to the toppermost of the poppermost.\" By 1963, they meant it enough to issue an ultimatum. \"We said to [manager] Brian Epstein, 'We're not going to America till we've got a Number One record,'\"�Paul McCartney�said. So he and�John Lennon�went to the home of the parents of Jane Asher, McCartney's girlfriend, where � \"one on one, eyeball to eyeball,\" as Lennon put it � they wrote \"I Want to Hold Your Hand,\" an irresistibly erotic come-on framed as a chaste, bashful request. The lightning-bolt energy of their collaboration ran through the band's performance, taped October 17th, 1963. It lunges out of the speakers with a rhythm so tricky that the first wave of bands to cover the song often couldn't figure it out; Lennon and McCartney constantly switch between unison and harmonies, both of them snapping and whooping like they own the melody. Every element of the song is a hook, from Lennon's�Chuck Berry�riffing to�George Harrison's string-snapping guitar fills to the quartet's syncopated hand claps. With advance orders at a million copies, \"I Want to Hold Your Hand\" was released in the U.K. in late November, and promptly bumped the band's own \"She Loves You\" from the top of the charts.\n",

But McCartney's original reading � cut on June 14th, 1965, at EMI's Abbey Road studios in London � remains the most beautiful and daring of all: a frank poem of regret scored and sung with haunted elegance. There are no other�Beatles�on the record. None were needed. George Martin's arrangement for a string quartet emphasized lower-octave melancholy, while McCartney's almost whispered vocal reverberated with longing in the big, dark spaces where drums and electric guitars would have been. The melody, he said, came to him in a dream: \"My dad used to know a lot of old jazz tunes, I thought maybe I'd just remembered it from the past.\" McCartney auditioned the song for Martin, with the working title \"Scrambled Eggs,\" in a hotel room in Paris in January 1964 � before the Beatles had even landed in America � but would not record it for another year and a half. \"We were a little embarrassed about it,\" McCartney confessed. \"We were a rock & roll band.\" A Number One single in America, \"Yesterday\" was, in his own words, \"the most complete song I have ever written.\"\n",

Written in 1952 by white teenagers Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller for R&B singer Willie Mae \"Big Mama\" Thornton, it was a smash for her, and was immediately covered by a handful of country acts. (The chorus, Leiber noted in 1987, was code for \"You ain't nothin' but a motherfucker.\") Presley, always on the lookout for hillbilly/R&B crossover possibilities, added the song to his stage act in the spring of 1956, after hearing Freddie Bell and the Bellboys sing it in Las Vegas. On June 5th of that year, his hip-swiveling performance of \"Hound Dog\" on The Milton Berle Show became an instant sensation � notorious enough that on his next TV appearance, he crooned the song to a top-hatted basset hound. The next morning, Presley and his band got deadly serious about \"Hound Dog,\" perfecting it over 31 takes at New York's RCA Studios. With snarling vocal authority, D.J. Fontana's tommy-gun drumrolls and slashing guitar by Scotty Moore, Presley transformed the song's blues changes and put-down rhymes into a declaration of independence from his generation's cold, rigid elders. \"Hound Dog\" was the flip side of \"Don't Be Cruel,\" Presley's third RCA single. It was also the song in which he told the world: Like it or not, rock & roll is here to stay.\n",
