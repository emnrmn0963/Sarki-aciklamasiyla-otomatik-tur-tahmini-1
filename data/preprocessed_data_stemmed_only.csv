Imagine,"John Lennon wrote ""Imagine,"" his greatest musical gift to the world, one morning early in 1971 in his bedroom at Tittenhurst Park, his estate in Ascot, England. His wife, Yoko Ono, watched as Lennon sat at the white grand piano now known around the world from films and photographs of the sessions for his Imagine album and virtually completed the song: the serene melody; the pillowy chord progression; that beckoning, four-note figure; and nearly all of the lyrics, 22 lines of graceful, plain-spoken faith in the power of a world, united in purpose, to repair and change itself.",Imagine�(Capitol/Apple),John Lennon,John Lennon,"Lennon, Phil Spector, Yoko Ono","October, 1971",9 weeks,No. 3,"[['john', 'lennon', 'wrote', 'imagin', 'greatest', 'music', 'gift', 'world', 'one', 'morn', 'earli', '1971', 'bedroom', 'tittenhurst', 'park', 'estat', 'ascot', 'england'], ['wife', 'yoko', 'ono', 'watch', 'lennon', 'sat', 'white', 'grand', 'piano', 'known', 'around', 'world', 'film', 'photograph', 'session', 'imagin', 'album', 'virtual', 'complet', 'song', 'seren', 'melodi', 'pillowi', 'chord', 'progress', 'beckon', 'fournot', 'figur', 'nearli', 'lyric', '22', 'line', 'grace', 'plainspoken', 'faith', 'power', 'world', 'unit', 'purpos', 'repair', 'chang']]"
What's Going On,"""What's Going On"" is an exquisite plea for peace on Earth, sung by a man at the height of crisis. In 1970, Marvin Gaye was Motown's top male vocal star, yet he was frustrated by the assembly-line role he played on his own hits. Devastated by the loss of duet partner Tammi Terrell, who died that March after a three-year battle with a brain tumor, Gaye was also trapped in a turbulent marriage to Anna Gordy, Motown boss Berry Gordy's sister. Gaye was tormented, too, by his relationship with his puritanical father, Marvin Sr. ""If I was arguing for peace,"" Gaye told biographer David Ritz, ""I knew I'd have to find peace in my heart.""",What's Going On�(Tamla),Marvin Gaye,"Gaye, Renaldo Benson, Al Cleveland",Gaye�,"Feb, 1971",13 weeks,No. 2,"[['what', 'go', 'exquisit', 'plea', 'peac', 'earth', 'sung', 'man', 'height', 'crisi'], ['1970', 'marvin', 'gay', 'motown', 'top', 'male', 'vocal', 'star', 'yet', 'frustrat', 'assemblylin', 'role', 'play', 'hit'], ['devast', 'loss', 'duet', 'partner', 'tammi', 'terrel', 'die', 'march', 'threeyear', 'battl', 'brain', 'tumor', 'gay', 'also', 'trap', 'turbul', 'marriag', 'anna', 'gordi', 'motown', 'boss', 'berri', 'gordi', 'sister'], ['gay', 'torment', 'relationship', 'puritan', 'father', 'marvin', 'sr', 'argu', 'peac', 'gay', 'told', 'biograph', 'david', 'ritz', 'knew', 'id', 'find', 'peac', 'heart']]"
Respect,"Otis Redding wrote ""Respect"" and recorded it first, for the Volt label in 1965. But Aretha Franklin took possession of the song for all time with her definitive cover, made at Atlantic's New York studio on Valentine's Day 1967. ""Respect"" was her first Number One hit and the single that established her as the Queen of Soul. In Redding's reading, a brawny march, he called for equal favor with volcanic force.

Johnny B. Goode,"""Johnny B. Goode"" was the first rock & roll hit about rock & roll stardom. It is still the greatest rock & roll song about the democracy of fame in pop music. And ""Johnny B.

The opening lines were, McCartney once said, ""a hopeful message for Julian: 'Come on, man, your parents got divorced. I know you're not happy, but you'll be OK.'"" McCartney changed ""Jules"" to ""Jude"" � a name inspired by Jud from the musical�Oklahoma!�� and presented a demo tape to Lennon, who loved the song. He also thought McCartney was singing to him, about his relationship with�Yoko Ono�and the strains on the Lennon-McCartney partnership.

My Generation,"The Who's guitarist,�Pete Townshend, supposedly wrote ""My Generation,"" his immortal fuck-off to the elders in his way, on his 20th birthday, May 19th, 1965, while riding a train from London to Southampton for a television appearance. The song wasn't intended as a youth-mutiny anthem at first. It was a Jimmy Reed-style blues, reflecting Townshend's fears about the impending strictures of adult life, famously captured in the line ""Hope I die before I get old."" ""My Generation' was very much about trying to find a place in society,"" he told�Rolling Stone�in 1987. ""I was very, very lost. The band was young then. It was believed that its career would be incredibly brief."" Instead, ""My Generation"" became the Who's ticket to legend � their first British Top Five hit, and a battle cry for young mod rebels � and it established Townshend as a fearless and eloquent songwriter. ""My Generation"" went through months of arranging and rerecording before the Who got it right, in two takes, on October 13th, 1965. Townshend opened the song with a two-chord assault that beat punk rock to the punch by more than a decade. Bassist John Entwistle took the solo breaks with crisp, grunting aggression � he had to buy three new basses to finish the recording, since his Danelectro's strings kept breaking and replacement strings weren't available. (He ended up playing the song on a Fender.)�Roger Daltrey's stuttering, howling performance, Townshend and Entwistle's R&B-inspired backing vocals, and the upward key changes created a vivid, mounting anxiety that climaxed with a studio re-creation of the Who's live gear-trashing finales, with Townshend spewing feedback all over Keith Moon's avalanche drumming. Four decades later, Townshend and Daltrey are all that remain of the original Who, and they still play ""My Generation"" at every show � now with the fire and wisdom of age.",My Generation�(Universal)�,The Who,Pete Townshend,Shel Talmy,"Nov, 1965",5 weeks,No. 74,"[['who', 'guitaristpet', 'townshend', 'supposedli', 'wrote', 'gener', 'immort', 'fuckoff', 'elder', 'way', '20th', 'birthday', 'may', '19th', '1965', 'ride', 'train', 'london', 'southampton', 'televis', 'appear'], ['song', 'wasnt', 'intend', 'youthmutini', 'anthem', 'first'], ['jimmi', 'reedstyl', 'blue', 'reflect', 'townshend', 'fear', 'impend', 'strictur', 'adult', 'life', 'famous', 'captur', 'line', 'hope', 'die', 'get', 'old'], ['gener', 'much', 'tri', 'find', 'place', 'societi', 'toldrol', 'stonein', '1987'], ['lost'], ['band', 'young'], ['believ', 'career', 'would', 'incred', 'brief'], ['instead', 'gener', 'becam', 'who', 'ticket', 'legend', 'first', 'british', 'top', 'five', 'hit', 'battl', 'cri', 'young', 'mod', 'rebel', 'establish', 'townshend', 'fearless', 'eloqu', 'songwrit'], ['gener', 'went', 'month', 'arrang', 'rerecord', 'got', 'right', 'two', 'take', 'octob', '13th', '1965'], ['townshend', 'open', 'song', 'twochord', 'assault', 'beat', 'punk', 'rock', 'punch', 'decad'], ['bassist', 'john', 'entwistl', 'took', 'solo', 'break', 'crisp', 'grunt', 'aggress', 'buy', 'three', 'new', 'bass', 'finish', 'record', 'sinc', 'danelectro', 'string', 'kept', 'break', 'replac', 'string', 'werent', 'avail'], ['end', 'play', 'song', 'fender'], ['roger', 'daltrey', 'stutter', 'howl', 'perform', 'townshend', 'entwistl', 'rbinspir', 'back', 'vocal', 'upward', 'key', 'chang', 'creat', 'vivid', 'mount', 'anxieti', 'climax', 'studio', 'recreat', 'who', 'live', 'geartrash', 'final', 'townshend', 'spew', 'feedback', 'keith', 'moon', 'avalanch', 'drum'], ['four', 'decad', 'later', 'townshend', 'daltrey', 'remain', 'origin', 'still', 'play', 'gener', 'everi', 'show', 'fire', 'wisdom', 'age']]"

Yesterday,"Paul McCartney's greatest ballad holds a Guinness World Record as the most recorded song of all time; seven years later, there were 1,186 versions by artists as varied as�Frank Sinatra,�Otis Redding�and�Willie Nelson. But McCartney's original reading � cut on June 14th, 1965, at EMI's Abbey Road studios in London � remains the most beautiful and daring of all: a frank poem of regret scored and sung with haunted elegance. There are no other�Beatles�on the record. None were needed. George Martin's arrangement for a string quartet emphasized lower-octave melancholy, while McCartney's almost whispered vocal reverberated with longing in the big, dark spaces where drums and electric guitars would have been. The melody, he said, came to him in a dream: ""My dad used to know a lot of old jazz tunes, I thought maybe I'd just remembered it from the past."" McCartney auditioned the song for Martin, with the working title ""Scrambled Eggs,"" in a hotel room in Paris in January 1964 � before the Beatles had even landed in America � but would not record it for another year and a half.

I Want to Hold Your Hand,"As a young, struggling beat group, playing grueling gigs at grubby bars,�the Beatles�had an in-joke to cheer themselves up: declaring that they were going ""to the toppermost of the poppermost."" By 1963, they meant it enough to issue an ultimatum. ""We said to [manager] Brian Epstein, 'We're not going to America till we've got a Number One record,'""�Paul McCartney�said. So he and�John Lennon�went to the home of the parents of Jane Asher, McCartney's girlfriend, where � ""one on one, eyeball to eyeball,"" as Lennon put it � they wrote ""I Want to Hold Your Hand,"" an irresistibly erotic come-on framed as a chaste, bashful request. The lightning-bolt energy of their collaboration ran through the band's performance, taped October 17th, 1963. It lunges out of the speakers with a rhythm so tricky that the first wave of bands to cover the song often couldn't figure it out; Lennon and McCartney constantly switch between unison and harmonies, both of them snapping and whooping like they own the melody. Every element of the song is a hook, from Lennon's�Chuck Berry�riffing to�George Harrison's string-snapping guitar fills to the quartet's syncopated hand claps.

Purple Haze,"It is one of the unforgettable opening riffs in rock: a ferocious, stomping guitar march, scarred with fuzz and built around the dissonant ""devil's interval"" of the tritone. And it launched not one but two revolutions: late-Sixties psychedelia and the unprecedented genius of�Jimi Hendrix. For the first time, Hendrix, bassist Noel Redding and drummer Mitch Mitchell got to show off their acrobatic onstage chemistry on record � and they somehow managed to condense it to an under-three-minute blaze of overdubbed guitar sorcery. (The first chord of its main riff has come to be known among guitarists as the ""Hendrix chord."") The song, which Hendrix wrote on December 26th, 1966, in the dressing room of a London club, also served as a showcase for his brilliant, often contradictory lyrical gifts (boiled down from a much longer initial draft called ""Purple Haze � Jesus Saves""). He spiked the surging rhythmic confidence of the Experience with intimate pictorial tension: ""Actin' funny, but I don't know why/'Scuse me while I kiss the sky.""

In the closing solo, Hendrix echoed his screaming Strat with an additional shrieking guitar put through a new harmonic-manipulation device called an Octavia and played back at double speed.

Hound Dog,"""Hound Dog"" was a hit before Elvis Presley sang it, and he was famous for singing it before he recorded it. Written in 1952 by white teenagers Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller for R&B singer Willie Mae ""Big Mama"" Thornton, it was a smash for her, and was immediately covered by a handful of country acts. (The chorus, Leiber noted in 1987, was code for ""You ain't nothin' but a motherfucker."") Presley, always on the lookout for hillbilly/R&B crossover possibilities, added the song to his stage act in the spring of 1956, after hearing Freddie Bell and the Bellboys sing it in Las Vegas. On June 5th of that year, his hip-swiveling performance of ""Hound Dog"" on The Milton Berle Show became an instant sensation � notorious enough that on his next TV appearance, he crooned the song to a top-hatted basset hound. The next morning, Presley and his band got deadly serious about ""Hound Dog,"" perfecting it over 31 takes at New York's RCA Studios. With snarling vocal authority, D.J. Fontana's tommy-gun drumrolls and slashing guitar by Scotty Moore, Presley transformed the song's blues changes and put-down rhymes into a declaration of independence from his generation's cold, rigid elders.

Let It Be,"Inspired by the church-born soul of Aretha Franklin, an anxious Paul McCartney started writing ""Let It Be"" in 1968, during the contentious sessions for the White Album. His opening lines � ""When I find myself in times of trouble/Mother Mary comes to me"" � were based on a dream in which his own late mother, Mary, offered solace during a tumultuous time for both the band and the culture, assuring him that everything would turn out fine. ""I'm not sure if she used the words 'Let it be,'"" McCartney recalled, ""but that was the gist of her advice."" McCartney unveiled a skeletal version of ""Let It Be"" to the other Beatles at an even worse time: during the initial, disastrous Let It Be rehearsals in January 1969. John Lennon, the group's resident heretic, was brutally dismissive, mistaking McCartney's secular humanism for self-righteous piety. Yet the Beatles put special labor into the song, getting the consummate take on January 31st � the day after their last live performance, on the roof of their Apple offices in London. (R&B musician Billy Preston, a friend of the band's from its early days, contributed the gospel-flavored organ part.) George Harrison later took a couple of cracks at adding a guitar solo: The single version features his solo from April 30th, 1969, and the album cut's solo was taped at the final Beatles recording session, on January 4th, 1970.
